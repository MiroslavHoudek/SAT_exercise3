Einstein's riddle

This is an exercise in SAT (based on [1]), specifically using SAT solver to crack the Einstein's riddle.

It will have a hardcoded "board", which would have 5 hardcoded columns and rows ( 5 people vs their respective houses colour, pet, beverage, cigarette brand and nationality). In the end this might be expanded to support arbitrary columns.

The solver will also have hardcoded statements about the 5 people, but ultimately should support some simple plain text syntax to modify the constraints.
